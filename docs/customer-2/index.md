        I ordered one, then saw that it was so useful we proceeded to toss out all our whiteboards and replace them with Vibe’s.  It’s the best collaboration device we have at our office for memorializing any and all types of meetings – from administrative tasks to software design sessions. Incredible device, saves us time and money and allows us to build our AI software products faster! Congratulations on a game changer!

    testimonial:
      body: |
        Vibe’s collaboration factor has been huge. Vibe helps our team integrate research, notes and screenshots for a project into a single canvas - we no longer have interrupt the creative process to check notes in other locations. When juggling multiple clients, it’s incredibly helpful to have everything saved in one place so you can easily pick up where you left off. As a UX designer, I like how easy Vibe is to pick up a stylus and sketch on. And for big projects we can even have several people working on a single canvas at once - even from remote locations.

    testimonial:

        I’ve always been a big whiteboard user - even my staff like to joke about this - but it can be a pain to share out a detailed plan you just worked on...  you have to take a picture or assign someone to write something up. With Vibe, I can now just hit “send” after a meeting and share that board with whoever I want. Vibe will save each board automatically, so I can always pull a board back up during any meeting to show people what we’ve discussed. Even better, we like how you can invite remote coworkers in to collaborate on the board in real time from other devices. Vibe is a gamechanger.

          We selected Vibe for use in our public training center with individuals, small companies and
          corporate clients. Our selection criteria were based on four requirements:

          **Range of capabilities**
          We “draw” training notes and exercises, save/email docs and collaborate between local and remote
          participants – all through Vibe

          **Product support/training**
          Vibe team provides premier client support and training

          **Simple/intuitive operation**
          We received, unwrapped, assembled and began using Vibe in less than 40 minutes...absolutely intuitive!

          **Low total operating costs/cost of ownership**
          Vibe provides greatest range of capabilities, highest value and NO ongoing licensing and annual costs.

          Vibe is “Best of Breed” in the real-time digital whiteboard market space!
