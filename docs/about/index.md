    Vibe was founded in 2016 by former Microsoft developers looking for a better way to collaborate globally.  

    Even with video conferencing, productivity and workflow apps, and a commitment to a distributed team,
    it was difficult to accomplish what could be achieved simply when face-to-face. We knew that there had to be a
    better way. So we built Vibe.   

    Headquartered in Seattle, WA, Vibe is fully funded and has 35+ employees.
